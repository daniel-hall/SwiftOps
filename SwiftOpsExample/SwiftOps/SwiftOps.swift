When an Operation Group is started, all the comprised Operations are run asynchronously and in parallel; when they have _all_ finished executing, a tuple containing all of their results (or errors) is returned to a completion closure. Operation Groups can also be chained with subsequent Operations using the 'then' method, or can be combined using the 'or' method with another Operation Group that runs if any of the first Group's Operations throw an error. Operation Groups can also be added together using the 'and' method to create larger groups of Operations to run in parallel. Since Operation Groups already have the inputs provided for all of their comprised Operations, they don't require any additional input to start running, just a completion closure.
