/// - Declaration of how the function should run ('sync', 'async', 'ui') and automatic dispatch queue management as appropriate
/// - Automatic extrapolation of the nature of composed Operations.  For example, Operation.sync.then(Operation.sync) -> Operation.sync, but Operation.sync.then(Operation.async) -> Operation.async
